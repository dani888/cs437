      <h2>CS637 Homework 1 SQL review, HTTP, HTML5 part 1, mysql, php, setup</h2>
      <p>Due Monday, Sept. 16 in class, on paper. Be sure to get a UNIX/Linux
        account for cs637 by Monday, Sept. 9, to list your username for the
        needed mysql account, and gain access to topcat.cs.umb.edu.<br>
        <br>
        1. a. Basic HTML and URLs: if you really know HTML, you can skip part a.
        of this problem. Just state so on your homework submission<span style="font-weight: bold;">.
        </span>Read Chap. 1-3 of Duckett for basic HTML. Learn about absolute
        and relative URLs, by reading Chap. 4 of Duckett and looking at the
        examples in Murach &amp; Harris (M&amp;H), pg. 29 (either edition) For
        more practice (optional), go through the HTML tutorial at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">http://www.w3schools.com/html/</a>
        through "HTML Lists". Use a plain editor to compose a web page
        test1.html with page title "My title", contents entitled "Important
        links", and a relative link to a copy of this file (hw1.html) named
        hw1copy.html, also in the same directory on the server, and an absolute
        link to the root of our departmental website, with appropriate
        descriptive text&nbsp;for the user to see. &nbsp;Include the text of
        test1.html in your homework submission.</p>
      <p>b. HTTP. Since hw1.html is in directory cs637 of our webserver's
        document root, its URL is http://www.cs.umb.edu/cs637/hw1.html, as you
        can verify by browsing to to this URL in your browser. Show the HTTP GET
        request and response, to the level of detail of the example shown on pg.
        7 of M&amp;H and also on slide 16 for the first class. Our server is <span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Consolas, &quot;Lucida Console&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">Apache/2.4.18.</span></p>
      <div> </div>
      <p>2. Review SQL. Read M&amp;H Chap. 18. Go to <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/">sqlzoo.net</a>,&nbsp;
        Pull down the Tutorials menu, and select the following tutorials: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Select from Nobel:&nbsp; 4, 7&nbsp; (number them&nbsp; 1-4,
          1-7)&nbsp; For 7, use LIKE to match part of the winner name.</li>
        <li> Select within select: &nbsp;2, 4, 6&nbsp;&nbsp;(2-2, etc.)</li>
        <li> Sum and count: 2, 4, 6</li>
        <li> More Joins: 3, 6, 7, 9 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Show your answers (copy and paste the SQL query). If an error message
        seems useless, try another database for the query--it might give better
        error messages.<br>
        <br>
        3 MySQL. Within a week, user ronghui, for example, will have an account
        on mysql on topcat with username ronghui, password ronghui, and a
        database named ronghuidb.&nbsp; To access it, login to topcat and use
        the command:</p>
      <p><code>mysql -u ronghui -D ronghuidb -p</code></p>
      <p>and enter ronghui at the password prompt.&nbsp; Another way is shown on
        pg. 111 of M&amp;H:</p>
      <p><code>mysql -u ronghui -p</code><code></code><code><br>
          Enter password: ronghui</code><code><br>
          use ronghuidb</code> </p>
      <p>Verify your mysql account is working by logging in to system
        topcat.cs.umb.edu and using the mysql command. See <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/cs637/AccessToCSHosts.html">Access
          to cs.umb.edu systems from offsite</a> for instructions on logging in
        from offsite. </p>
      <p>a. Create a table named t1 with columns "id", and integer, and
        "message", a varchar(40). Insert 2 rows into it and then display the
        rows.&nbsp; Show a script of this session in your homework. To make a
        script, type <code>script </code>at the Linux prompt before using the
        mysql command, then do the database work, exit from mysql, and do
        another exit to finish the script.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      b. Note that the book applications are available at <a href="http://topcat.cs.umb.edu/book_apps">http://topcat.cs.umb.edu/book_apps</a>
      on the web and since the web server <i>document root </i>is at
      /var/www/html on topcat, they are available in the topcat filesystem at
      /var/www/html/book_apps. Copy the SQL script my_guitar_shop1.sql from the
      _create_db subdirectory to your cs637/hw1 homework directory on topcat.
      Try to load your mysql database on topcat with this script and report on
      your success or problems.&nbsp; Note: You will need to edit out the create
      database and create user commands from my_guitar_shop1.sql, as you have
      access only to your own database, and no privileges to create additional
      users.
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>4. a. Until students have XAMPP installed, we'll use topcat for simple
        PHP execution from the command line.&nbsp; Code up the future value for
        loop of pg. 77 (either edition) in a complete php program
        future_value.php and execute it from the command line: <code>topcat$
          php future_value.php</code>. Create directory hw1 in your cs637
        directory on topcat and put future_value.php in it, making it have a
        filesystem path ~/cs637/hw1/future_value.php. The original code is
        available in book_apps/ch02_future_value/display_results.php, i.e. full
        filesystem path
        /var/www/html/book_apps/ch02_future_value/display_results.php. If
        necessary (2nd ed), replace "$future_value =" with "$future_value +=
        ..." that calculates the same amounts. Note that your program should
        have no HTML in it, since there is no browser involved here. Use echo to
        print the answer. Show your program in your homework paper and report
        your success or problems running it. </p>
      <p>b. Run the future value example as a web application by browsing to <code>http://topcat.cs.umb.edu/book_apps/ch02_future_value/</code>.
        Try out valid values and invalid values as shown on pg. 81 (either
        edition). Note that if some of the fields are valid and others invalid,
        the form is redisplayed with the valid values filled in. Users hate to
        loose valid input!&nbsp; Make the app display a different error message,
        and explain what you did to make it happen.</p>
      <p>5. Report on your <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/cs637/DevelopmentSetup.html">DevelopmentSetup</a>
        progress and/or problems.&nbsp; </p>
